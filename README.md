# cryptotoy

This is a toy, not a tool. Your data is probably not safe here!

## So, what is this thing, anyway?

Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Actually, the product of my boredom.

I'm not a crypto expert, this probably isn't secure, and it's probably not wise to pretend it is, so don't; or do, but do so at your own risk. If you *are* a crypto xpert, by all means, audit this (when it's done -- there's nothing here to audit right now) and let me know what you think; I'm not going for secure, just functional, but if I manage both, I'll be ecstatic!

## If you're not a crypto expert, why are you wasting your time implementing a crypto algothm?

To experiment with key manipulation and light crypto in general. And because I'm bored and want to branch into a field I haven't played in already. I've always been fascinated by cryptography, which made it a good candidate to be my next field of choice.

I don't expect to become a crypto expert working on this, but it's a fun project and it might spark some interest. My idea and implementation may or may not be original (and I'm guessing they're not), but it's a start. My plan, once I've completed cryptotoy, is a complimentary project, cracktoy, to attempt to find and exploit weaknesses in cryptotoy's algorithm and/or implemntation, so I can learn from these and release a new cryptotoy that is more secure.

Not that cryptotoy is intended to be secure. Ever.

## Okay, then... why bother with a crypto tool that you claim isn't secure?

You did't read the first line of this README, did you? This is a toy, not a tool. I'm doing this for fun. Anything else that comes of this is just icing.
