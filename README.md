# cryptotoy

This is a toy, not a tool. Your data is probably not safe here!

---

## So, what is this thing, anyway?

Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Actually, the product of my boredom.

I'm not a crypto expert, this probably isn't secure, and it's probably not wise to pretend it is, so don't; or do, but do so at your own risk. If you *are* a crypto expert, by all means, audit this (when it's done -- there's nothing here to audit right now) and let me know what you think; I'm not going for secure, just functional, but if I manage both, I'll be ecstatic!

## If you're not a crypto expert, why are you wasting your time implementing a crypto algothm?

To experiment with key manipulation and light crypto in general. And because I'm bored and want to branch into a field I haven't played in already. I've always been fascinated by cryptography, which made it a good candidate to be my next field of choice.

I don't expect to become a crypto expert working on this, but it's a fun project and it might spark some interest. My idea and implementation may or may not be original (and I'm guessing they're not), but it's a start. My plan, once I've completed cryptotoy, is a complimentary project, cracktoy, to attempt to find and exploit weaknesses in cryptotoy's algorithm and/or implemntation, so I can learn from these and release a new cryptotoy that is more secure.

Not that cryptotoy is intended to be secure. Ever.

## Okay, then... why bother with a crypto tool that you claim isn't secure?

You didn't read the first line of this README, did you? This is a toy, not a tool. I'm doing this for fun. Anything else that comes of this is just icing.

## Your last commit was over a year ago and none of the core functionality is implemented. Why?

If you've been following along, you'll note that Cryptotoy is the product of my boredom. At some point, life happened and I found myself no longer bored. At the moment, I'm finding myself bored enough to update this README, but not bored enough to pick this project back up. Yet.

## So, you've lost interest?

No, I just don't have time at the moment.

## Well, then, can I take it over?

You're welcome to fork it. I'm not sure what good that'll do you without the design specs that I haven't yet shared, given the lack of functional code, but you're welcome to do so anyway. I'm not looking to pass the project off to anyone, this is still something I wish to complete at some point; as I said, I don't have time at the moment, but that won't always be the case.

## If I want to take this over, can you share the design specs?

First, why would you want to take over the project without first knowing what the project actually is? Seems a bit risky to me, taking over a project without first knowing the details. Second, and I repeat myself, I'm not looking to pass this on. I appreciate your desire to get involved and I assure you that, once I've completed development of the first functional release, any and all constructive involvement in the project will be welcomed. Right now this is just a proof of concept for myself, so it wouldn't make sense to ask someone else to step in and write it for me.

## So, you _are_ looking for help, then?

No. Well, not right now. Like I said, once I've gotten it working(-ish), I'll be more than happy to accept any contributions one might wish to offer. You're welcome to follow this project so you can know when that time coems or, if you want a more personal interaction, contact me directly about it; I'll be more than happy to let you know when I need help and what, specifically, I need help with.
